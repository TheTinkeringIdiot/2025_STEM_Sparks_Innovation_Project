<system-reminder>The user has mentioned a key word or phrase that triggers this reminder. 

<debugging-workflow>
1. **Understand the codebase** - Read relevant files/tables/documents to understand the codebase
2. **Identify 5-8 most likely root causes** - List potential reasons for the issue
3. **Choose the 3 most likely causes** - Prioritize based on probability and impact
4. **Decide whether to implement or debug** - If the cause is obvious, implement the fix and inform the user. If the cause is not obvious, continue this workflow.

Steps for Non-obvious Causes:
5. **For each of the 3 causes, validate by adding targeted logging/debugging**
6. **Let the user test** - Have them run the code with the new logging
7. **Fix when solution is found** - Implement the actual fix once root cause is confirmed
8. **Remove debugging logs** - Clean up temporary debugging code

Include relevant debugging commands/tools and explain your reasoning for each step.

<system-reminder>The user has mentioned a key word or phrase that triggers this reminder.

<investigation-workflow>
1. **Assess scope**: Read provided files directly. Use code-finder for unknown/large codebases, direct tools (Read/Grep/Glob) for simple searches.

2. **Use code-finder when**: Complex investigations, no clear starting point, discovering patterns across many files, unclear functionality location.

3. **Use direct tools when**: Simple searches in known files, specific paths provided, trivial lookups.

4. **Flow**: Start with context → code-finder for broad discovery → understand before suggesting → answer first, implement if asked.

5. **Multiple agents**: Split non-overlapping domains, launch parallel in single function_calls block. Example: backend/, frontend/, tests/ agents.

Example: "Investigate and make plan out Stripe integration" → Use multiple code-finder tasks
Example: "Where is combat implemented?" → Use code-finder task
Example: "Do we have a formatDate function" → Use grep/bash/etc tools directly
</investigation-workflow>

This workflow ensures efficient investigation based on task complexity.

CRITICAL: You MUST first read ~/.claude/guides/prompting-guide.md for comprehensive guidance on writing effective prompts. If you haven't read this guide yet in this conversation, read it immediately before proceeding with any prompt-related suggestions.

Only after reading and understanding this guide should you provide prompt improvement recommendations.

If the user is not looking to improve a prompt, or you have already read the guide, ignore this reminder.
